## ⚡ Customer Problems

Before implementing IAM Identity Center, the customer faced several challenges:

- 🔑 **Multiple Credentials** – Users had to remember separate usernames and passwords for each AWS account and application.  
- 🌀 **Decentralized Access Control** – No unified way to manage permissions across multiple AWS accounts.  
- 🔐 **Security Risks** – Inconsistent authentication methods increased the chance of weak or unmanaged credentials.  
- ⏱️ **Time-Consuming Onboarding** – Provisioning new employees required manual account setup in each application.  
- 📉 **Operational Overhead** – Admins spent excessive time managing identities and troubleshooting access issues.  
- ❌ **Lack of Visibility** – No central place to monitor user access, making audits and compliance checks difficult.  

## 🧩 Problem → Solution → Why We Choose 

1. 🔑 **Problem: Multiple Credentials**  
   Users had to log in with separate usernames and passwords for every AWS account and connected application. This not only caused confusion but also increased the risk of weak or reused passwords.  

   ✅ **Chosen Solution: Single Sign-On (SSO) via IAM Identity Center**  
   🎯 **Why We Chose It:**  
   - IAM Identity Center gives employees one login portal for all AWS accounts and apps.  
   - This reduces password fatigue and improves user experience.  
   - By linking with corporate identity providers like Active Directory, Okta, or Azure AD, users can use the same work credentials everywhere.  
   - Less chance of password-related security incidents.  

---

2. 🌀 **Problem: Decentralized Access Control**  
   Permissions were managed separately in each AWS account. This led to inconsistencies, manual errors, and lack of centralized governance.  

   ✅ **Chosen Solution: Centralized Access Management with IAM Identity Center**  
   🎯 **Why We Chose It:**  
   - IAM Identity Center allows defining **permission sets** (roles + policies) once and applying them across multiple AWS accounts.  
   - Makes managing permissions easier and consistent across environments (dev, test, prod).  
   - Eliminates the risk of giving too much or too little access to users.  
   - Saves time for administrators by avoiding duplication of access setups.  

---

3. 🔐 **Problem: Security Risks**  
   Inconsistent authentication methods and unmanaged credentials exposed the system to threats like unauthorized access and credential leaks.  

   ✅ **Chosen Solution: MFA Integration + Secure Authentication Policies**  
   🎯 **Why We Chose It:**  
   - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) ensures login security even if a password is compromised.  
   - IAM Identity Center integrates with existing corporate security policies (e.g., password strength rules, session limits).  
   - Ensures compliance with regulatory standards like ISO, GDPR, HIPAA where strong authentication is mandatory.  
   - Reduces attack surface for phishing or brute-force attacks.  

---

4. ⏱️ **Problem: Slow Onboarding and Offboarding**  
   New employees had to be manually added to each AWS account and application. Similarly, when someone left the company, removing their access was slow and error-prone, creating insider threat risks.  

   ✅ **Chosen Solution: Automated User Provisioning (via SCIM with AD/Okta/Azure AD)**  
   🎯 **Why We Chose It:**  
   - IAM Identity Center supports **System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)** for automatic user creation/deletion.  
   - New hires get instant access to required systems, improving productivity.  
   - Employees leaving the company automatically lose access, reducing insider threat risks.  
   - Saves admin time and ensures least-privilege principle is always maintained.  

---

5. 📉 **Problem: Operational Overhead**  
   Admins spent too much time creating users, assigning permissions, and troubleshooting access issues for every individual.  

   ✅ **Chosen Solution: Group-Based Assignments in IAM Identity Center**  
   🎯 **Why We Chose It:**  
   - Instead of assigning permissions user-by-user, admins can manage groups (e.g., Developers, Finance, HR).  
   - Users automatically inherit permissions based on their group membership.  
   - Reduces repetitive manual work and prevents errors.  
   - Scales better as the organization grows in size.  

---

6. ❌ **Problem: Lack of Visibility in User Access**  
   Without a central monitoring system, it was hard to track who accessed what, making compliance audits and troubleshooting very difficult.  

   ✅ **Chosen Solution: Centralized Auditing with CloudTrail + IAM Identity Center Logs**  
   🎯 **Why We Chose It:**  
   - CloudTrail records all access activity in AWS accounts.  
   - IAM Identity Center adds logging for SSO sessions and user access.  
   - Provides a **single pane of glass** for monitoring and compliance reporting.  
   - Helps security teams quickly detect unusual access patterns and prevent misuse.
